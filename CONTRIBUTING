# Contributing to Project Robyn

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

We have built the first public version of this code for any person interested in
understanding how to allocate media budget, understand the influence of
non-media variables and encourage data-led decision making in marketing. We are
offering a solution that describes the contribution of each marketing channel to
the sales outcomes for that purpose. Forecasting and scenario planning and
geographic hierarchies are the next features to come.
