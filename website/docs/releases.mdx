## 3.9.0 (2022-12-15)
### Time-series validation feature
- **Feat**: new time series validation via time-series train/val/test dynamic splits and Adjusted R2 and NRMSE metrics reported for each group feature #545. We are adding an additional `train_size` hyperparameter to pick the size of the training size, which by default will iterate in the range of 0.5-0.8. Given it's a hyperparameter, you can change the range or fix the value manually. Turn on/off this feature using the `ts_validation` new parameter on `robyn_run()`; default is set to `FALSE` for now. This is an important step for the forecasting coming function.
- **Feat**: new `ts_validation()` function to plot time-series validation and convergence results. Generated and exported by default when `ts_validation = TRUE`, and when `export = TRUE`, creating `ts_validation_plot.png` file.
- **Fix**: updated Adjusted R2 calculation (`get_rsq()`) for time-series validation using same denominator.
- **Fix**: results are not sorted by lowest errors now to keep iteration results actual order.
- **Feat**: added prophet monthly component to enrich decomposition results #525
- **Fix**: correct solID (not "1_1_1") for fixed hyperparameters recreated models.
- **Recode**: reduced the size of `xDecompVec` on `OutputCollect` by keeping pareto-front models only.
- **Docs**: changed standard inputs on [demo.R](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/demo.R) file for modeling window to include more data (3 years by default).

## 3.8.2 (2022-11-23)
### Memory friendly outputs, progress bars for Pareto-front models, bugs and docs
- **Feat**: new status bars for Pareto-Front models per trial to provide information on calculation status
- **Feat**: included carryover results into pareto_aggregated.csv output and `OutputCollect$xDecompAgg$carryover_pct`
- **Feat**: new error message shows which hyperparameters inputs are missing #543
- **Fix**:  substantially reduced the size of `robyn_run()` and `robyn_outputs()` results (around -80% compared with 3.8.1 version's size) by removing redundant and unused data from outputs #534
- **Fix**: invalid argument type in check_factorvars() and issue recreating calibrated models #520
- **Fix**: `add_penalty_factor` parameter now works correctly with JSON files and `robyn_refresh()` #543
- **Fix**: correct hyper-parameters length for custom data #533
- **Fix**: bug in RobynLearn when checking numerical data #532
- **Fix**: removed .iData format for legacy demo .RData files

## 3.8.0 (2022-10-27)
### Bootstrapped CI, Immediate vs Carryover, Multi-channel calibration

- **Feat:** Added in-cluster bootstrapped confidence intervals (CI) for ROAS and CPA. We treat each cluster of Pareto-optimal model candidates as a sample from a local optimum of the entire population. Default parameters can be customized manually with `boot_n` and `sim_n` arguments.
- **Feat:** New `robyn_calibrate()` function that replaces  previous un-exported function `calibrate_mmm()`. The new calibration method is able to separate immediate & carryover effects. When calibrating using experimental results, only the immediate response and its future carryover serve as a calibration target, as opposed to previously the total response. The historical response is excluded from calibration.
- **Feat**: Enabled multi-channel calibration so we can use experiments that measured more than one channel with a single experiment to be used for calibration (i.e. incrementality experiment measured all `fb` but you had `fb_brand` and `fb_perf` as two separate media channels/variables).
- **Feat:** Added 2 new plots into model one-pager: bootstrapped CI plot and immediate vs carryover response plot.
- **Feat**: Changed default Pareto-fronts from `3`  to `‚Äùauto"` to pick the N that contains at least 100 models (threshold can be changed manually with `min_candidates` parameter).
- **Recode**: improved CodeFactor's code quality score from C- to A
- **Feat**: Additional CI outputs containing revamped plot and CSV file.
- **Feat**: Enabled turning off parallel calculations when `cores = 1`.
- **Fix**: Fixed few minor bugs and doumentations (#496, #506, #507, #515)

## 3.7.2 (2022-09-01)
### CRAN update, partial results, more reproducibility

- **Feat**: wrap `robyn_mmm()` with a `tryCatch()` to return partial results if the function crashes after a certain time running and warns the user when this happens
- **Feat**: auto-detect categorical variables (no need to set `factor_vars` parameter in `robyn_inputs()`)
- **Feat**: include R and Robyn's versions to JSON files and InputCollect for reproducibility
- **Feat**: export/save raw data input for reproducibility (raw_data.csv file)
- **Feat**: set `Robyn::dt_prophet_holidays` as default input on `dt_holidays` parameters
- **Fix**: inverted counters in `check_hyperparameters()` message #474
- **Fix**: force date format before binding rows in `robyn_refresh()` #480
- **Fix**: `check_context()` was being skipped in some cases
- **Fix**:  when only 1 categorical value with 2 unique values crashed one-hot-encoding
- **Docs**: updated templates for issues and pull requests

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/compare/v3.7.1...v3.7.2

**Full Changelog since last CRAN update**: https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/compare/v3.6.3...v3.7.2

## 3.7.1 (2022-08-26)
### JSON import/export, reactivate spend exposure fitting Latest

- **Feat**: new `robyn_read()` and `robyn_write()` functions to save and load Robyn models in a transparent, flexible, and cost-efficient way using JSON instead of RDS files (read [more](https://www.facebook.com/groups/robynmmm/posts/1252761488825315/)); also, new `print` methods for both objects containing the most relevant information
-  **Feat**: new `robyn_recreate()` to rebuild any model's `InputCollect` and `OutputCollect` objects based on their JSON files and data
- **Feat**: reactivated spend exposure fitting and plotting #463

## 3.7.0 (2022-07-27)
### Total recoding, UX feats, and combined errors fix

- **Recode**: got rid of data.table dependency for r2py wrapper and removed all `globalVariables` associated noise
- **Recode**: all code is now clean and formatted under the tidyverse code style for better code reading and standardization
- **Feat**: trimmed functionality for response curves on one-pagers outputs to have coherent ranges plotted

- **Feat**: enabled organic media variables to be calibrated (no spend)
- **Fix**: when best model based on minimum combined errors was tied with other models, inconsistent outputs (one-pagers / clustering). Standardized combined errors methodology with new `errors_scores()` function, especially normalizing errors before filtering models. The largest the "error_score", the better the model's performance #428
- **Fix**: show blue dots on top of grey dots in Pareto plots #420
- **Fix**:  positive/negative colour palette on waterfall plot when all values are positive
- **Fix**:  set prophet's print as disabled when prophet_vars input is NULL (off)

## 3.6.2 (2022-03-31)
### Allocation and plot improvements, new warnings, bugs fixed

- **Viz**: removed redundant information on plots and standardized styles and contents on all visualizations.
- **Feat**: new `date_min` and `date_max` parameters on `robyn_allocator()` to pick specific date range to consider mean spend values ([user request](https://www.facebook.com/groups/robynmmm/permalink/1072870463481086)).
- **Feat**: new `plot` methods for `robyn_allocator()` and `robyn_save()` outputs, and `print` method for `robyn_inputs()` with and without hyperparameters.
- **Feat**: provide recommendations on calibration inputs depending on the experiments' confidence, spending, and KPI measured [#307](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/307).
- **Feat**: warn and avoid weekly trend input when data granularity is larger than "week".
- **Fix**: issues on several `robyn_allocator()` specific cases ([#349](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/349), [#344](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/344), [#345](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/345)), especially when some coefficients were 0.

## 3.6.0 (2022-02-22)

- New **hyperparameter "lambda"** finds MOO-optimal lambda and thus removes the need of manual lambda selection.
- New optional **hyperparameter `penalty.factor`** that further extends hyperparameter spaces and thus potentially better fit.
- New **optimisation convergence rules & plots** for each objective function showing if set iterations have converged or not (NRMSE, DECOMP.RSSD, and MAPE if calibrated)
- Improved **response function** now also returns the response for exposure metrics (response on imps, GRP, newsletter sendings, etc) and plots. Note that argument names and output class has changed. See updated `demo.R` for more details.
- More **budget allocation stability** by defaulting fitting media variables from `paid_media_vars` to `paid_media_spends`. Spend exposure fitting with Michaelis Menten function will only serve `robyn_response()` function output and plotting. `robyn_allocator()` now only relies on direct spend - response transformation.
- Default **beta coefficient signs**: positive for paid & organic media and unconstrained for the rest. Users can still set signs manually.
- New **print methods** for `robyn_inputs()`, `robyn_run()`, `robyn_outputs()`, and `robyn_allocator()` outputs to enable visibility on each step's results and objects content.
