## 1. Downloading the latest R version

It is necessary to have the [**R 4.0.0 version (or higher)**](https://www.r-project.org/) installed in order to be able to run this code. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To
[download R.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), please choose your
preferred [CRAN mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). **Please make sure you have restarted your R session once you have installed the latest R version.**

**Optional (and recommended)**: after you've installed R, you may install [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for a better and smoother experience. RStudio IDE is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R and Python. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace.

## 2. Installing the package

To install or update Robyn to the latest stable version of the package, run:
```
install.packages("Robyn")
```

**NOTE**: If you're interested in installing the latest or a specific **dev version** instead, run `remotes::install_github("facebookexperimental/Robyn/R")`. If you haven't installed the `remotes` package previously, run `install.packages('remotes')` first.

Robyn also requires the Python library [Nevergrad](https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/).
**You must install it once for the code to work properly**. Please find [here](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html) more info about installing Python packages via reticulate.

1. First step is to install the [reticulate package](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) (if you haven't before) and load it:
```
install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```
2. Install `nevergrad` Python library. You have 2 options:

- **Option 1: using PIP**

```
virtualenv_create("r-reticulate")
py_install("nevergrad", pip = TRUE)
use_virtualenv("r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
```

- **Option 2: using conda**

```
conda_create("r-reticulate")
conda_install("r-reticulate", "nevergrad", pip = TRUE)
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")
```

In case nevergrad still cannot be imported after installation, please locate your python file and run this line using your path:
```
use_python("~/Library/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/bin/python")
```

## 3. Getting started with the [demo.R](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/demo.R) script

Open the [demo.R](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/demo.R) script in the `Robyn/demo/` folder as a quick start guide that aims to cover most common use-cases.
The demo will allow you to test the package using a simulated dataset.
