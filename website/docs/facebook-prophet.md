title: Facebook Prophet - Trend, Seasonality and Holiday Effects
---

**Prophet** has been included in the code in order to improve fit and forecast
time series by decomposing the data into trend, seasonality and holiday
components. **Prophet** is a Facebook original procedure for **forecasting time
series** data based on a model where **non-linear trends** are fit with yearly,
weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time
series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.
