It is necessary to have the [**R 4.0.3 version (or higher)**](https://www.r-project.org/) installed in order to be able to run this code. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To
[download R.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), please choose your
preferred [CRAN mirror.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). **Please make sure you have restarted your R session once you have installed the latest R version.**

There are three main script files within the [**code on Github**](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/tree/master/source):
1. **fb_robyn.exec.R:** Where the scripts below are called and executed. This will be the main script you will be working with.
2. **fb_robyn.func.R:** Where all the feature engineering process, modelling functions and plotting are stored.
3. **fb_robyn.optm.R:** Where the budget allocator and its plotting functions reside.

Please **download** and **open** all of them in your R environment.
