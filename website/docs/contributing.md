This project has a non-fixed release cycle but we will be making bug fixes in
response to user feedback and adding features. Please let us know if you
encounter a bug by filing an issue. Github issues is also the right place to ask
questions about using the code.

We appreciate all contributions. If you plan to contribute new features or
extensions to the core, please first open an issue and discuss the feature with
us.
