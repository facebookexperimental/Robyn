## Introduction

  * **What is Robyn?**: Robyn is an experimental, semi-automated and open-sourced Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) package from Meta Marketing Science. It uses various machine learning techniques (Ridge regression, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, time-series decomposition for trend & season, gradient-based optimization for budget allocation, clustering, etc.) to define media channel efficiency and effectivity, explore adstock rates and saturation curves. It's built for granular datasets with many independent variables and therefore especially suitable for digital and direct response advertisers with rich data sources. 
  
  * **Why are we doing this?**: MMM used to be a resource-intensive technique that was only affordable for "big players". As the privacy needs of the measurement landscape evolve, there's a clear trend of increasing demand for modern MMM as a privacy-safe solution. At Meta Marketing Science, our mission is to help all businesses grow by transforming marketing practices grounded in data and science. It's highly aligned with our mission to democratizing MMM and making it accessible for advertisers of all sizes. With Project Robyn, we want to contribute to the measurement landscape, inspire the industry and build a community for exchange and innovation around the future of MMM and Marketing Science in general.
  
## Quick start for R

**1. Installing the package**
  
  * Install Robyn latest package version:
```{r}
## CRAN VERSION
install.packages("Robyn")

## DEV VERSION
# If you don't have remotes installed yet, first run: install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("facebookexperimental/Robyn/R")
```

  * If it's taking too long to download, you have a slow or unstable internet connection, and have [issues](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/309) while installing the package, try setting `options(timeout=400)`.
  
  * Robyn requires the Python library [Nevergrad](https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/). If encountering Python-related 
  error during installation, please check out the [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/install_nevergrad.R) as well as this [issue](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/189) to get more info.
  
  * For Windows, if you get openssl error, please see instructions
  [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54558389/how-to-solve-this-error-while-installing-python-packages-in-rstudio/54566647) and
  [here](https://dev.to/danilovieira/installing-openssl-on-windows-and-adding-to-path-3mbf) to install and update openssl.

**2. Getting started**

  * Use this [demo.R](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/tree/main/demo/demo.R) script as step-by-step guide that is
  intended to cover most common use-cases. Test the package using simulated dataset provided in the package.
