###### How To Start ######

The following files are contained in the zip:

Four .R script files:
- fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.exec.R # you only need this script to execute, it calls the other 3 scripts
- fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.func.R # this contains all major functions and data preparation
- fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.plot.R # this contains all plot functions
- fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.bayes.R # this contains adapted functions from the library parBayesianOptimization

Two .csv files:
- de_simulated_data.csv # this is our simulated data set
- generated_holidays.csv # this contains holidays of all countries from the library prophet

All files should be placed in the same folder

Please make sure you've installed all library specified in fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.exec.R first

Initial setting is running 1000 random search trails with geometric adstockinng. After installing all libraries, if you select all and run in fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.exec.R, the script should run and produce one plot
